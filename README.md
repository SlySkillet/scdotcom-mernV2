# scdotcom-mernV2

This is the second iteration of my portfolio site. This is a platform I am creating to document my learning and research.

My goals for this iteration were:

- create a MongoDB database to store blog posts
- access those posts with express.js routing
- serve front and backend with an Ubuntu server

I will be working on content and additional coding projects in the coming months.
