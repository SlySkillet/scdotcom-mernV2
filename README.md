[Visit SimonConrad.com](https://simonconrad.com) to read more about me and my journey in software engineering

[Read my Blog](https://simonconrad.com/blog) This transformed simonconrad.com from a static portfolio to a fullstack application. This is a programming project and a writing project. At the moment, the API is all on the administrator side. That's where I create, read, update and delete my blog posts. I hope you enjoy!

This is the second iteration of my portfolio site. I wanted to learn to build a webserver and host my portfolio site there instead of using vercel. I felt it was an important step in my learning journey to create and deploy a full stack application using digital ocean. In this version, I've created a blog to share my research in the tech industry. I inted for this site to be a living document of my progress in writing code.

My goals for this iteration were:

- create a MongoDB database to store blog posts
- access those posts with express.js routing
- serve front and backend with an Ubuntu server

I will be working on content and additional coding projects in the coming months.
